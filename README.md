# PortfolioComparison
* This program uses a Python Jupyter notebook to compare 5 years of data from large hedge funds returns and compares them to the S&P 500. 

* It calculates and plots risk metrics, Sharpe ratios, and beta values for different portfolios, and I've also included a custom selection of three stocks to compare.

* The data was gathered from google finance and imported using .csv files.

* It would be simple to turn this into a lot of these lines into methods and make a dashboard for comparing different portfolios strengths, weaknesses, risk tolerance, etc.
